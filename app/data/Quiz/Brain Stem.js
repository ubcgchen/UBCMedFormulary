    explain: "This question requires understanding the mechanism of action of drugs used to treat MS. In this case, the drug that works by altering cytokine production is (B) glatiramer acetate. The other drugs in this class would include the interferons. This class has the lowest efficacy and can only be injected. This class can only be injected because they are either peptides, thus if taken orally, would result in their breakdown. (A and (D) both target lymphocyte migration (SP1 inhibitor and anti VLA4, respectively). (C) targets lymphocyte function (anti-CD20)",

(A) and (D) both target lymphocyte function (anti-CD20 and anti-CD52, respectively), but are both monoclonal antibodies, and thus are injected and not taken orally.

In this vignette, we are presented with a patient with MS that is getting worse despite being on DMF. DMF is an oral medication that targets lymphocyte function. (C) is a medication that targets cytokine production and has lower efficacy than DMF. (D) is an effective medication, but it targets lymphocyte migration. (B), (E) are in the same class as DMF, but are not necessarily more effective (and not as clear cut as the correct answer) as they are both oral medications that target lymphocyte function. (A) is the correct answer because it targets lymphocyte function (CD52) and is more effective. Monoclonal antibodies are currently the most effective medication for MS (except for autologous HSCT).",

His neurologist decides to use a stronger drug, Drug X, but first orders a serology test for John Cunningham Virus (JCV) to assess the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).

    explain: "This question requires understanding a serious adverse effect of a drug used to treat MS. In this vignette, we are presented with a patient with worsening relapsing-remitting MS and is about to be started on pending serology for JCV. This is because some immune-modulating drugs can activate latent infections or allow for viruses that normally do not cause any symptoms in immunocompetent patients. Patients on immune-modulating drugs like MS patients can be immunocompromised due to the drug decreasing immune surveillance that keeps latent infections in check. In this case (C) is the drug most commonly associated with JCV reactivation in MS patients. This leads to a condition called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. You would worry about PML in a patient with MS on natalizumab when they start developing new typical MS symptoms or atypical MS symptoms.",
