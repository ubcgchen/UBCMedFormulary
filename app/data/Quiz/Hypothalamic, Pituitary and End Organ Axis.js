He initially report low sexual desiure, loss of AM erections, insomia, fatigue, and erctile dysfunction.

      "A 43 y/o male with schizophrenia and hypertension presents to the clinic for a checkup. He has recently noticed a decrease in his sexual functioning (erectile dysfunction, low libidio), and he also notices that his chest has grown in size. You decide to do a pituitary workup and find low AM testosterone, and elevated prolactin (100 µg/L). You check his medications: risperidone (atypical antipsychotic), propranolol, losartan, and lithium. Which of his medications is most likely the cause of the hyperprolactinemia?",

She complains that recently she hasn’t felt herself and has low sex drive, hence has not had any sexual relationships in the past 2 months. She denies headaches and any vision changes, and her peripheral vision test is normal. You decide to do a pituitary workup after a negative pregnancy test. Her tests show low LH, FSH, elevated prolactin (250 µg/L), normal cortisol, and normal TSH. She isn’t on any medication except for the occasional acetaminophen. An MRI shows a mass on her pituitary gland. Which of the following medications is an effective treatment option for this presentation?",

He was recently diagnosed with secondary hypothyroidism and hypogonadism due to hypothalamo-pituitary sarcoidosis and was started on levothyroxine and testosterone four weeks ago. At the time of diagnosis, his other pituitary related hormones were low-normal. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this presentation?",
    choices: [
      "Levothyroxine replacement increased the metabolism of cortisol, leading to an acute adrenal crisis",
      "Levothyroxine dose was too high and caused thyrotoxicosis",
