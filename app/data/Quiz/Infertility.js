In this vignette, we are presented with a sexually active patient with frothy yellowish-greenish vaginal discharge, a strawberry cervix, and a lab report of an anaerobic parasitic flagellated protozoa. All of these point towards a Trichomonas vaginalis infection. The treatment for a Trichomonas infection is metronidazole (Flagyl) 2g PO (1 dose). Metronidazole is an effective antibiotic against many anaerobic bacteria and protozoa because its mechanism of action (inhibition of DNA synthesis) requires a partial reduction (chemical reaction) step that only occurs in anaerobic bacteria and protozoans. Patients should also never take EtOH when on metronidazole as this will cause a disulfiram-like reaction (nausea, vomiting, flushing of skin, tachycardia, and shortness of breath)."

From here appendicitis would seem likely, however, a history reveals that she has had UTI symptoms such as dysuria, unusual discharge from her vagina, new sexual partners, and an adenexal mass with tenderness. This raises the suspicion of PID, which should be on the differential for any female patient presenting with abdo pain. Assuming it is PID, the treatment in this case (severe/inpatient PID)  would be: cefoxitin + doxycycline OR clindamycin + gentamicin (B). If the PID was outpatient or milder the treatment could be the same as N. gonorrhea treatment + extra dose of azithromycin or metronidazole 500 mg BID PO 14 days. Hence, (B) is the correct answer."

LNG is a hormonal progestin medication, hence its effects are similar to progesterone by acting as a progesterone receptor agonist. Therefore, we could predict its effect by understanding the role of progesterone in fertility.

        explain: "This question requires understanding the mechanism of combined hormonal contraceptives in treating hirsutism and acne. Here we need to understand the pathophysiology of hirsutism, which is driven by testosterone levels. Hence, the treatment should be focused on reducing testosterone levels. Combined OCPs contain both estrogen and progesterone equivalents. The estrogen will actually increase SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin) levels, which will sequester more free testosterone, thus lowering levels of testerosntone. Hence, (C) is the correct answer. Moreover, estrogens will also reduce LH production. While the progesterone component may have anti-androgen properties, which means it could act as an antagonist of the androgen receptor (testosterone is an agonist of the androgen receptor)."

Hence, this allows it to act as an antagonist in chronically high estrogen states (like PCOS) at the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, and as an anti-estrogen at the uterus and cervix (thinning of lining). This blocks the negative feedback of estrogen, thereby allowing for increased FSH release and potential of ovulation. Therefore, (A) is the correct answer. (B) correctly describes the mechanism of letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, that can also be used in PCOS."

She is diagnosed with PCOS and we are asked if metformin is an appropriate treatment. In patients with elevated BMI and T2DM, there usually is  increased insulin resistance. This causes a compensatory increase in insulin levels since the body is not appropriately responding to the insulin (hyperinsulinemia). The excess insulin will act on theca cells, and potentiate the effect of LH on them. Metformin is an effective treatment option in this case because metformin helps improve insulin sensitivity (decrease insulin resistance), this will eventually lead to reduced insulin levels, which will decrease the potentiation of LH activity, hence (D) is the correct answer."
