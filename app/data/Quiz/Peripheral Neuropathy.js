    explain: "This question requires understanding LA pharmacokinetics. In this vignette we are presented with inadequate analgesia with LA despite following standard protocols, which suggests that inadequate LA reached its target (pain fibers). In tissues that are inflamed, there is a decrease in pH due to the increased number of inflammatory cells (increased metabolic demand leading to more acid production), which can affect PK. LAs (except for benzocaine) tend to have a pKa of around 8 (mildly basic), thus a drop in pH will lead to more LA to be in its cation form (R-NH+) than its base form (R-N + H+). LAs in the cation form will not be able to cross the lipophilic nerve sheath to reach the axonal membrane and the VG Na+ channels to exert their effect.  Therefore, (A) correctly describes this predicament. Although, LAs need to be in the charged form to block Na+ channels, if the LA can not even reach the axonal membrane, then there will be no analgesia. (E) is wrong, Epi will cause vasoconstriction, so it would actually limit distribution away from the site, thus also increasing concentration of LA at the site. NOTE: Chemistry explanation - Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (pH = pKa + log([B]/[BH+])) when pH = pKa, then B = BH+ since log(1)=0 (both sides of the equation are then equal).  If pH > pKa, then B > BH+ because log(>1) will be positive to balance both sides of the equation. When pH < pKa, then B < BH+ because log(<1) will be negative to balance both sides. In this case pH is decreasing, therefore, less B than normal.",

In this case, we would want to use a LA that is able to be absorbed through the mucosal surface to reach the pain fibers to allow for analgesia. Therefore, we would want to use a highly lipophilic LA, since lipophilic drugs diffuse more readily through lipid membranes. Thus, (A) is the correct answer. Benzocaine also has a low pKa, meaning that virtually 100% of it will be in base form at pH 7+, thus it has little systemic absorption given its poor solubility in aqueous solutions like blood. This allows us to administer topical benzocaine over large surface areas like the oral cavity without worrying about systemic complications like methemoglobin formation. It should be noted that benzocaine has a different pathway in blocking Na+ channels by traversing through the lipid membrane to reach the channel rather than blocking the channel from the intracellular side like other LAs.",

LAs have to first traverse the nerve sheath and other lipid membranes like the epi-, peri-, and endoneurium, myelin sheath etc.. in its absorbable form, the base form (unionized). Once it reaches the axonal membrane, LAs must then be absorbed through the cellular membrane into the axoplasm (intracellular side). However, the cation form of LAs is what confers its ability to block Na+ channels, therefore some proportion of LAs after equilibrating will be in its charged form and will be able to block the Na+ channel from the intracellular side. Now the generation and propagation of APs will be blocked via stabilization of the inactivated state. An exception to this is benzocaine, which can reach the Na+ channel through the lipid membrane and block the channel. Therefore, only (D) correctly describes the mechanism of lidocaine.",

    explain: "This question requires understanding the concept of differential block with LAs. In this vignette we have an anxious pregnant patient that thinks the epidural isnâ€™t enough because she can still walk. The reason why this is fine is because the LA preferentially block smaller diameter fibers before larger diameter fibers, which is helpful in our case because smaller diameter fibers like Type AÎ´ and Type C carry pain sensation and are blocked, while our larger fibers like Type AÎ± carry motor function are left unblocked. It was also thought that this was also because LAs block unmyelinated fibers before myelinated ones, but there is evidence against this preferential block. Hence, (C) is the correct answer. (D) is false. 3 consecutive nodes of Ranvier in myelinated fibers need to be blocked, also unmyelinated fibers do not have nodes of Ranvier, since these are pockets of unmyelinated axon between myelin sheaths."

This is correctly shown in (A).

Here Lidocaine has the lowest pKa, thus weâ€™d expect it to have the fastest onset of action, while procaine has the highest pKa, so weâ€™d expect it to have the slowest onset of action. This is correctly shown in (A). This relationship is thought to exist because at lower pKas, more drug will be in its unionized form, which will allow it to pass through membranes (e.g. axonal, nerve sheath, myelin) to reach the site of action (axonal sodium channels). This can be demonstrated with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (pH = pKa + log([B]/[BH+])) when pH = pKa, then B = BH+ since log(1)=0 (both sides of the equation are then equal).  If pH > pKa, then B > BH+ because log(>1) will be positive to balance both sides of the equation. When pH < pKa, then B < BH+ because log(<1) will be negative to balance both sides.

Increased lipophilicity and increased plasma protein binding are directly related with increased duration of action. This is because more lipophilic drugs (higher Vds) tend to stay in the body longer due to an increased distribution phase as they linger around in adipose tissue (slow release into the blood) versus distributing into the blood compartment where it can be metabolized and excreted. Similarly, increased protein binding will keep more LA in the body and protect it from metabolism, since only free drug can be metabolized and excreted (normally). Thus, this will also increase the duration of action. Hence, (E) is the correct answer as it increases both the plasma protein binding and lipophilicity of the LA.",

In this vignette we are presented with a patient who receives a supratherapeutic intercostal nerve block with bupivacaine. If we think about the mechanism of LAs, any system that utilizes voltage gated Na+ channels could be affected such as the heart and nervous system. An intercostal injection also allows for large amounts of the LA to be systemically absorbed compared to some other sites. Therefore, we would expect systemic side effects. Initial LA toxicity presents with inhibition such as tinnitus and blurred vision (impaired nerve conduction) or sedation and dizziness. This can be followed by an excitation phase, where inhibitory neurons of the CNS are blocked by the LA, which leads to an excitatory state, thus causing tonic-clonic seizures, tremor, and myo-clonus. At extremely high doses LAs can cause cardiovascular toxicity, in fact bupivacaine has a high potential for cardiotoxicity, thus we would also expect ventricular arrhythmia and myocardial depression. This is thought to be due to its lipophilicity (higher potency) and accumulation in the heart. Therefore (D) is the correct answer. We can treat LA toxicity with a lipid emulsion known as lipid rescue, which hopefully draws the lipophilic LAs into the emulsion rather than in the plasma or in tissue where it can cause toxicity. Administration of benzodiazepines can also increase the seizure threshold.",

In GBS, there is production of antibodies against nerves, which causes damage and inflammation leading to demyelination.
