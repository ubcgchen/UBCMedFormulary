      "A 25 y/o patient with an incomplete spinal cord injury at C7 after a parkouring accident presents to his physiatrist appointment with a flexed knee, extended knee, adducted thigh, and flexed toe. This presentation is usually triggered after urinary tract infections and causes him lots of pain. He is prescribed baclofen to help with his upper motor neuron injury. Which of the following correctly describes the mechanism of action of the treatment?",
    choices: [
      "Activate cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1) on presynaptic neurons to decrease release of excitatory neurotransmitter",
      "Activate GABA-B receptors to decrease the release of excitatory neurotransmitters and inhibit transmission, on pre and postsynaptic neurons, respectively",
      "Inhibit AMPA glutamate receptors on postsynaptic neurons to block excitatory glutamate transmission",
      "Inhibit nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions to inhibit muscle contraction",
      "Inhibit NMDA glutamate receptors on presynaptic neurons to decrease the release of excitatory neurotransmitters",
    ],
    correct:
      "Activate GABA-B receptors to decrease the release of excitatory neurotransmitters and inhibit transmission, on pre and postsynaptic neurons, respectively",
